This repository brings together all code, scripts, and resources to run and analyze both the **regional LSTM model** and **local LSTM models** for short-term streamflow forecasting under operational constraints.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `Imputation/` ‚Äî Scripts and classes for **operational imputation** of hydrological, climatic, and geographic variables.  
- `LOCAL_MODELS/` ‚Äî Sequence generation and forecasting with local LSTM models, each trained independently for individual catchments.  
- `REGIONAL_MODELS/` ‚Äî Data preparation and forecasting with the regional LSTM model, trained globally on data from all catchments.  
- `FIGURES/` ‚Äî Scripts to generate figures, plots, and maps used in the article.  
- `data/` (optional) ‚Äî Original data files (CSV or binary formats), if applicable.

## üìù Overview

This research compares two LSTM training approaches:

1. **Regional Model:** Trained once on combined data from multiple catchments to learn global hydrological patterns.  
2. **Local Models:** Trained individually for each catchment, serving as a traditional benchmark.  

The goal is to evaluate which configuration improves the prediction of mean and maximum streamflow at 1- to 5-day horizons, captures extreme events, and generalizes under real operational conditions.

## üöÄ General Instructions

1. Clone the repository and create an environment (Conda or virtualenv) with the dependencies specified in each subfolder.  
2. First run the `Imputation/` scripts to generate complete, up-to-date time series.  
3. Then generate sequences and forecasts with `LOCAL_MODELS/` and evaluate the results.  
4. Finally, train and forecast with the global model using `REGIONAL_MODELS/`.  
5. Output results and metrics are stored in each module's `Trained_Models_TEST/` folder.
